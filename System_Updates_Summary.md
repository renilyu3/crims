# IMSCRC System Updates Summary

## Issues Fixed & Features Added

### âœ… **Issue 1: Scheduling System Access**

**Problem:** `http://localhost:5173/schedules` showed "Schedule Management - Coming Soon"
**Solution:**

- Updated `App.tsx` to import and use the `SchedulingDashboard` component
- Replaced the "Coming Soon" placeholder with the fully functional scheduling dashboard

### âœ… **Issue 2: PDL Action Buttons Not Working**

**Problem:** Action buttons in PDL list only worked for PDL ID 4, not for other PDLs
**Solution:**

- Fixed `PDLList.tsx` to use proper React Router navigation (`navigate()`) instead of `window.location.href`
- Updated action buttons to work consistently for all PDL records
- Added proper navigation handling for View and Edit actions

### âœ… **Issue 3: Missing Delete Functionality**

**Problem:** No delete button or functionality for PDL records
**Solution:**

- Added delete functionality to both `PDLList.tsx` and `PDLDetail.tsx`
- Implemented confirmation dialogs for safe deletion
- Added loading states during deletion process
- Added proper error handling for delete operations
- Delete button shows spinner during operation
- Successful deletion updates the UI immediately (removes from list or navigates back)

## Technical Improvements Made

### **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**

1. **Enhanced PDLList Component:**

   - Added `useNavigate` hook for proper routing
   - Added `deleteLoading` state management

2. **Enhanced PDLDetail Component:**
